# Generalization-of-Set-of-Features-for-The-Unified-Dataset-Using-Ant-Colony-Based-Feature-Selection


This study uses the Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to identify the optimal feature set for fault prediction, running it 50 times for better accuracy. The goal is to reduce the number of features while improving model performance. The Dynamic Classifier selects the best dataset based on accuracy for enhanced fault prediction.
